            <h3> Flask WSGI </h3>
            <p> Using Python's Flask, I made a simple web server gateway interface to run my programmed Python web application.
                This communicates with the client (user) requests back and forth with the backend (.py) script file. I chose Flask due to its simplicty, lightweight framework
                and how it results in a very structured clean piece of code - not having to follow nor adhere to strict convention. 
            </p>

            <h3> Automated Performance Monitoring </h3>
            <p> After researching few other performance metric frameworks, I chosen Prometheus as the monitoring module.
                This was mainly because getting informative insights were efficently straightforward. Since it would me to view
                how the web services were operating in my local development server, they are configured minimally with a few lines of codes. 
                In the plus side analysis of the performance can be viewed viusally on a diagrammatical graph i.e. Histogram,
                where you can see illustration of different metrics for different factors:  CPU/RAM; request time, response time
                Alternate means: `Flask-Performance` (FP) module can also be used to specifically monitor real API requests and retrieve accurate, real-time
                performance on-the-go, on-the-fly. Adding two lines of code using the FP module and generating a DSN (data source name) externally online, 
                allows the DSN URL website to check this program's API performance in an asynchronous way
